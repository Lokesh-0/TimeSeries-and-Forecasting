# TimeSeries and Forecasting

<p> Performed ARIMA on Bitcoin Weighted Prices from 2011-12-31 to 2020-12-31 with over 4.5 million timestamps, need more improvements working on it </p>
<p>Will add models LSTM, Facebook Prophet, xGBoost, Garch and more on the same timestamps used in ARIMA to compare the effectiveness of each model</p>


## API Data Extraction

API Status Codes

<p>
  200: Everything went okay, and the result has been returned <br>
  301: The server is redirecting you to a different endpoint. This can happen when a company switches domain names, or an endpoint name is changed<br>
  400: The server thinks you made a bad request. This can happen when you don’t send along the right data, among other things<br>
  401: The server thinks you’re not authenticated. Many APIs require login ccredentials, so this happens when you don’t send the right credentials to access an API<br>
  403: The resource you’re trying to access is forbidden: you don’t have the right permissions to see it<br>
  404: The resource you tried to access wasn’t found on the server<br>
  503: The server is not ready to handle the request<br>
